        <p id="aboutmetext">My name is Leonardo dos Santos Nunes, and I'm delighted to share a little bit about myself. At 29 years old, I'm currently pursuing my studies in software engineering at Centennial College, where I'm immersing myself in the fascinating world of technology.
        In terms of my educational background, I hold a degree in chemistry from Faculdades Oswaldo Cruz, which has equipped me with a strong foundation in scientific principles. Additionally, I've obtained a Specialization degree in Administration from Fundacao Getulio Vargas, where I gained valuable insights into effective management practices.
        For a significant portion of my professional journey, I dedicated eight years to Sherwin-Williams Company, where I worked as a Chemist Technician. This experience allowed me to develop a meticulous approach to my work, ensuring accurate analyses and precise results. Subsequently, I spent two years as a Research and Development Chemist at Arkema, where I had the opportunity to contribute to innovative projects within the field.
        Driven by a passion for data science, I have acquired knowledge in various tools and libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and Plotly. I am also familiar with microcontrollers like Raspberry Pi, as well as programming languages such as Python and frameworks like Flask. Additionally, I have proficiency in web technologies such as JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
        On a personal note, I am happily married to my wife Maria Eugenia, who is an accomplished architect. Together, we cherish our Brazilian heritage and embrace the diverse experiences that life has to offer.</p>
